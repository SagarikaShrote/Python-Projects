# Stock Analysis
Program to analyze a particular stock (which can be from any stock market around the world) and display the results using a candlestick chart.

## Getting Started
**You need to find the stock symbol/code for the stock you want to analyze a candletstick chart (for example GOOGLE = GOOG, Apple Inc = AAPL, ICICI BANK = ICICIBANK>BO) and enter that in the 'name attribute' of 'DataReader function' in the 'df variable'.**

There is also a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file with the same code as Python script. Use whichever you would like to.
